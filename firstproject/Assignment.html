 Professional career
2013–17: Top 100, ATP semifinal, top 10 victory

Tsitsipas began playing low-level ITF Futures events in Greece in 2013 shortly after turning 15, not long after he started competing on the junior tour.[28] He qualified for his first event on the ATP Challenger Tour at the Burnie International in early 2015 while still 16 years old, but lost his only main draw match to Benjamin Mitchell.[29] Tsitsipas won his first Futures title later that year and would go on to win a total of eleven such titles, five in singles and six in doubles, through the end of 2016.[28] He also won his first Challenger match near the end of 2015 in Mohammedia in Morocco.[29] Tsitsipas returned to Morocco a year later and reached his first two Challenger finals in back-to-back weeks at Mohammedia and Casablanca.[30] This success in Africa helped him crack the top 200 later that October.[31] Towards the end of that month, Tsitsipas was granted a qualifying wild card into the Swiss Indoors in Basel, his first ATP Tour appearance. He defeated Rajeev Ram in the opening round, but was unable to qualify after a loss to Robin Haase.[32]

Tsitsipas played in his first ATP main draw at the 2017 Rotterdam Open, where he lost his debut match to the eventual champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.[33] He also made his Grand Slam debut later that year as a qualifier at the French Open, but lost to Ivo Karlović in his first match.[34] After losing in qualifying at the US Open, Tsitsipas won his first Challenger title in Genova.[35] Overall, he qualified for a tour-best eight events during the season, including Wimbledon and the Shanghai Masters.[34] However, he did not win a tour-level match until the very end of the season when he defeated fellow Next Gen player Karen Khachanov in Shanghai.[36] At the European Open in Belgium the following week, Tsitsipas reached his first ATP semifinal as a qualifier. During the event, he upset hometown favorite and world No. 10 David Goffin for his first career top 10 victory.[36] With this run, Tsitsipas became the first Greek player to be ranked in the top 100 of the ATP rankings, accomplishing the feat at the age of 19. He also reached a high enough ranking to be named an alternate for the Next Gen ATP Finals.[37][38][39] Tsitsipas closed out the season with another Challenger final, this time in Brest.[40]

2018: Breakthrough, Masters final, Next Gen ATP Finals champion

Tsitsipas started the year at the Qatar Open where he lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 5 Dominic Thiem, again as a qualifier.[41] After losing in the opening round in his Australian Open debut, his best result in the rest of the early-year hard court season was another quarterfinal at the Dubai Tennis Championships.[42][43] Tsitsipas's first breakthrough of the year came at the Barcelona Open during the clay court season, where he reached his first career ATP final without dropping a set. During the ATP 500 Series tournament, he defeated three top 20 players including No. 7 Thiem, before losing to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a lopsided match. With this result, Tsitsipas moved into the top 50 and became the second Greek to reach an ATP final after Nicky Kalogeropoulos in 1973.[44] His performance also gained national attention in Greece, where tennis is not a widely popular sport.[45][7] The following week at the Estoril Open, he reached another semifinal. He also picked up a third career top ten victory over No. 8 Kevin Anderson.[46]

Tsitsipas closed out the clay court season by winning his first career Grand Slam match at the French Open against Carlos Taberner before losing to Thiem, the eventual runner-up.[6] He played the next Grand Slam at Wimbledon seeded for first time at No. 31.[47] He took advantage of the seed and produced his best result at a major tournament at the time, a fourth round loss to No. 10 John Isner.[48][49]

Tsitsipas had his second big breakthrough of the year in the lead up to the US Open. After reaching the semifinals in Washington,[50] he reached his second final of the season and first career Masters final at the Canadian Open. During the tournament, he became the youngest player to record four top ten wins in a single event, defeating No. 8 Dominic Thiem, No. 10 Novak Djokovic, No. 3 Alexander Zverev, and No. 6 Kevin Anderson in succession. He also saved match points in the latter two matches.[51][52] Tsitsipas lost the final to Nadal on his 20th birthday in a closer match than their first encounter. He also climbed to No. 15 in the world.[52][53]

At the US Open, Tsitsipas made his main draw debut, but was upset in the second round by fellow Next Gen player Daniil Medvedev.[54] He cited fatigue as a factor in the loss and proceeded to exit before the quarterfinals at three of his next four tournaments as well.[55][56] However, Tsitsipas was able to recover at the Stockholm Open. Playing as the third seed, he defeated second seed and No. 14 Fabio Fognini in the semifinals before winning in the final against veteran qualifier Ernests Gulbis. With the victory, he became the first Greek player to win an ATP title.[57] Tsitsipas closed out his season at the Next Gen ATP Finals. He was the top seed at the event and was drawn with Frances Tiafoe, Hubert Hurkacz, and Jaume Munar. Tsitsipas swept his group and defeated Andrey Rublev to advance to the final against second seed Alex de Minaur.[58][59] He defeated de Minaur in four sets to win the Next Gen Finals.[60] At the end of the year, Tsitsipas was named the ATP Most Improved Player for his breakthrough season.[
